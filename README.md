# maze
Analyzed through the lens of DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithms, the maze undergoes a comprehensive examination, revealing insights into its structural intricacies and providing a nuanced understanding of the optimal paths and connectivity within its labyrinthine confines.


To employ this code, execute the following command in the terminal:  
`g++ main.cpp -o out -pthread`  
This compiles the 'main.cpp' file, producing an executable named 'out' while ensuring proper threading support with the '-pthread' option.
